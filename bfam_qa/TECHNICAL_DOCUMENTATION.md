# BFAM Question Answering System Technical Documentation

## System Architecture Overview

This system implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture with dynamic knowledge base management. It combines the capabilities of a Large Language Model (Gemini) with a maintained knowledge base to provide accurate, context-aware responses about BFAM Inc.

### Core Components

1. Knowledge Base Layer
   - Text-based information storage
   - Version control and history tracking
   - Dynamic update capabilities
   - Section-based organization

2. Retrieval Layer
   - Context-sensitive information retrieval
   - Keyword-based section matching
   - Relevant context extraction

3. Generation Layer
   - Integration with Google's Gemini LLM
   - Context-aware prompt engineering
   - Response generation with source context

4. API Layer
   - RESTful endpoints
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting and error handling
   - CORS support

### Technical Implementation Details

#### 1. RAG Implementation
```python
def create_prompt(question: str, company_info: str) -> str:
    return f"""
    Context: {company_info}
    Question: {question}
    """
```
- Combines retrieved context with user questions
- Ensures responses are grounded in verified information
- Reduces hallucination risk

#### 2. Knowledge Base Management
```python
class CompanyInfoManager:
    - Dynamic content updates
    - Version history tracking
    - Section-based organization
```
- Maintains information integrity
- Tracks all changes with timestamps
- Supports content versioning

#### 3. Model Integration
```python
class GenerativeModel:
    - Automatic model selection
    - Retry mechanism
    - Rate limit handling
```
- Adapts to available models
- Handles API limitations
- Ensures reliable responses
