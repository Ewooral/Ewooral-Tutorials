1. # What is a hardware?
* **HARDWARE** is the equipment, or the physical devices, associated with a computer. For example, keyboards, mice, speakers, and printers are all hardware. 

2. # What is a software?

* **SOFTWARE** is computer instructions that tell the hardware what to do. Software is programs, which are instruction sets written by programmers.

* NB When you write software instructions, you are **programming**.

3. ## Software can be classified into two broad types:
1.  **APPLICATION SOFTWARE**: comprises all the programs you apply to a task, such as word processing programs, spreadsheets, payroll and inventory programs, and even games.
2. **SYSTEM SOFTWARE**: comprises the programs that you use to manage your computer,including operating systems such as Windows, Linux, or UNIX

4. ## Together, computer hardware and software accomplish three major operations in most programs:
1. **Input** — Data items enter the computer system and are placed in memory, where they can be processed.
2. **Processing** — rocessing data items may involve organizing or sorting them, checking them for accuracy, or performing calculations with them. The hardware component that performs these types of tasks is the central processing unit, or CPU.
3. **Output** — After data items have been processed, the resulting information usually is sent to a printer, monitor, or some other output device so people can view, interpret, and use the results.   
* Programming professionals often use the term data for input items, but use the term information for data that has been processed and output

* The instructions you write using a programming language are called **program code;** when you write instructions, you are **coding the program.**

5. ## Every programming language has rules governing its word usage and punctuation. 
- These rules are called the **language’s syntax**. Mistakes in a language’s usage are **syntax errors**.

- **Programs** that are currently running and data items that are currently being used are stored in **RAM** for quick access

- **RAM**  Random access memory, or RAM, is a form of internal, volatile memory. Internal storage is **volatile** — its contents are lost when the computer is turned off or loses power.

 6. # Permanent storage devices 
- are **nonvolatile** — that is, their contents are persistent and are retained even when power is lost.

- After a computer program is typed using programming language statements and stored in memory, it must be translated to **machine language** that represents the millions of **on/off** circuits within the computer.

7. ## Your programming language statements are called 
  **source code**. 
   ## translated machine language statements are 
   **object code**
