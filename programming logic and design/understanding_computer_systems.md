# What is a hardware?

## HARDWARE is the equipment, or the physical devices, associated with a computer. 
* For example, keyboards, mice, speakers, and printers are all hardware. 

# What is a software?

##  SOFTWARE is computer instructions that tell the hardware what to do. Software is programs, which are instruction sets written by programmers.

* NB When you write software instructions, you are programming.

## Software can be classified into two broad types:
1.  APPLICATION SOFTWARE: comprises all the programs you apply to a task, such as word processing programs, spreadsheets, payroll and inventory programs, and even games.
2. SYSTEM SOFTWARE: comprises the programs that you use to manage your computer,including operating systems such as Windows, Linux, or UNIX

## Together, computer hardware and software accomplish three major operations in most programs:
1. *Input* — Data items enter the computer system and are placed in memory, where they can be processed.
2. *Processing* — rocessing data items may involve organizing or sorting them, checking them for accuracy, or performing calculations with them. The hardware component that performs these types of tasks is the central processing unit, or CPU.
3. *Output* — After data items have been processed, the resulting information usually is sent to a printer, monitor, or some other output device so people can view, interpret, and use the results.   
* Programming professionals often use the term data for input items, but use the term information for data that has been processed and output

* The instructions you write using a programming language are called *program code;* when you write instructions, you are *coding the program.*
