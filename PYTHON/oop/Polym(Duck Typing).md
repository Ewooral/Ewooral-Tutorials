    Duck typing is one of the most useful concepts in object-oriented programming in Python. Using duck typing, we can implement polymorphism without using inheritance.


## What is duck typing?#

We say that if an object quacks like a duck, swims like a duck, eats like a duck or in short, acts like a duck, that object is a duck.




## Dynamic typing#

Duck typing extends the concept of dynamic typing in Python.

    Dynamic typing means that we can change the type of an object later in the code.

Due to the dynamic nature of Python, duck typing allows the user to use any object that provides the required behavior without the constraint that it has to be a subclass. See the code below for a better understanding of dynamic typing in Python:
```py
x = 5  # type of x is an integer
print(type(x))

x = "Educative"  # type of x is now string
print(type(x))

```
Implementing duck typing#

Let us see an example to implement this:
```py
class Dog:
    def Speak(self):
        print("Woof woof")


class Cat:
    def Speak(self):
        print("Meow meow")


class AnimalSound:
    def Sound(self, animal):
        animal.Speak()


sound = AnimalSound()
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

sound.Sound(dog)
sound.Sound(cat)


```
Explanation#

    In line 13, the type of animal is not defined in the definition of the method Sound.

    Type of animal is determined when the method is called, so it does not matter which object type you are passing as a parameter in the Sound() method, what matters is that the Speak() method should be defined in all the classes whose objects are passed in the Sound() method.

    We can use any property or method of animal in the AnimalSound class as long as it is declared in that class.

Conclusion#

Now coming back to why it is called Duck typing: So, if a bird speaks like a duck, swims like a duck, and eats like a duck, that bird is a duck.

Similarly, in the above example, the animal object does not matter in the definition of the Sound method as long as it has the associated behavior, Speak(), defined in the objectâ€™s class definition. In layman terms, since both the animals, dog and cats, can speak like animals, they both are animals. This is how we have achieved polymorphism without inheritance.

In the next lesson, we will discuss how to use abstract base classes in Python.
