## DESIGN IN THE SOFTWARE PROCESS
- Software development goes through a `process`
<!-- - `A process` takes a problem and creates a solution that involves software. -->
- A process is `iterative`
   
    These iterations consist of taking a set of requirements based on the
    identified problem(s) and using them to create `conceptual design`
    mock-ups and `technical design` diagrams, which can then be used
    to create a working software `implementation`, which must also pass
    `testing`. This process is repeated for each set of requirements,
    eventually creating a complete solution for the project.
Ok

- `Requirements` and `design` activities help you to understand 
what assumptions you need so that you create the right product.

`Requirements` are conditions or capabilities that must be 
implemented in a product, based on client or user request. They
are the starting point of a project- you must understand what your client wants.
