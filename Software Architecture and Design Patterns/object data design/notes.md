## DESIGN IN THE SOFTWARE PROCESS

- Software development goes through a `process`
- `A process` takes a problem and creates a solution that involves software.
- A process is `iterative`
   
    These iterations consist of taking a set of requirements based on the
    identified problem(s) and using them to create `conceptual design`
    mock-ups and `technical design` diagrams, which can then be used
    to create a working software `implementation`, which must also pass
    `testing`. This process is repeated for each set of requirements,
    eventually creating a complete solution for the project.
