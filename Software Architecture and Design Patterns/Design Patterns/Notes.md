# What is Design Patterns?
A practical proven solution to a recurring design problem
It allows you to use previously outlined
solutions that expert developers have often used to solve a
software problem, so you do not need to build a solution from
the basics of object-oriented programming principles every
time 

# Categories of Patterns
The Gang of Four’s pattern catalog contains 23 patterns. 
These patterns can be sorted into three different categories:
creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral
patterns. Some patterns might have elements that allow them
to span all of the categories – it is not always clear cut which
categories a pattern falls under. These categories were used to
simply organize and characterize the patterns in their book.
