# There are two major classes of variables or data types in Java.
  * Primitive types ( Numbers, Characters, boolean values ) 
    They are stored in the fastest available memory for quick access
    data types names are all in lowercase
    Note that a string is a complex object, not a primitive

    ``` java 
    int myVar = 5;
    int = data type 
    myVar = identifier

    ```
        Data types |   Bits  | Minimum | Maximum |
        byte           8         -128       127
        short          16        -32,768    32,767
        int            32        -2B +      2B +
        long           64        -9.2E+18   9.22337E+18
        float          32 
        double         64
    All primitive data types have helper classes that support conversion and formatting
  
  
  * Objects ()
