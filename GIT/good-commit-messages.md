# Writing a commit comes down to 5 parts

1. `type`: communicate the intent of a change

  `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
  
  - two most commonly used are 
    `fix` - use for bug fixes
    `feat` - use for code features
 
  - recommended `types` are:
 	build
 	chore
 	ci
 	docs
 	style
 	refactor
 	test
   
  - Optional Scope:
  
    * any additional information
    * Use nouns
    
  - description
  
    * includes a short message describing what the commit does
    * Written in the imperative. E.g. use add instead of adds or added
    
    
    
2. [optional body]: 
  - free form
  - explains changes you've made
  
  
3. [optional footer]:
  - follows the body with one blank line
  - must use a word token followed by a colon or a hashtag
  
  
  
  
## PRACTICAL APPLICATION
e.g fix: create nodejs application
    feat: add standard release support!
