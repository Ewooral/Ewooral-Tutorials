""" 
Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

'.' Matches any single character.​​​​
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
Example 3:

Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 20
1 <= p.length <= 30
s contains only lowercase English letters.
p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.
It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character '*', there will be a previous valid character to match.
"""

"""Solution
Approach 1: Recursion
Intuition

If there were no Kleene stars (the * wildcard character for regular expressions), the problem would be easier - we simply check from left to right if each character of the text matches the pattern.

When a star is present, we may need to check many different suffixes of the text and see if they match the rest of the pattern. A recursive solution is a straightforward way to represent this relationship.

Algorithm

Without a Kleene star, our solution would look like this:

"""


def match(text, pattern):
    if not pattern:
        return not text
    first_match = bool(text) and pattern[0] in {text[0], '.'}
    return first_match and match(text[1:], pattern[1:])
