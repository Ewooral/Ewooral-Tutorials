# Insertion sort
   Our first algorithm, insertion sort, solves the sorting problem introduced in Chapter 1:
   Input: A sequence of n numbers ha1; a2;:::;ani.
   Output: A permutation (reordering) ha0
    1; a0
    2;:::;a0
    ni of the input sequence such
    that a0
    1 a0
    2 a0
    n.
    The numbers that we wish to sort are also known as the keys. Although conceptually we are sorting a sequence, the input comes to us in the form of an array with n
    elements.
    In this book, we shall typically describe algorithms as programs written in a
    pseudocode that is similar in many respects to C, C++, Java, Python, or Pascal. If
    you have been introduced to any of these languages, you should have little trouble
